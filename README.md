# XNOR-Net
Implementations of the XNOR networks.

Initially binary networks were proposed at [Binarized Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02830) paper. After a while idea was updated at [XNOR-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05279) paper. In this repo additional layers for such networks exists. Now layers implemented only naive way, without real binary operations.

# TODO

- [x] Implement pytorch layers
- [x] Implement trainer
- [ ] Add keras implementation
- [ ] Update trainer
- [ ] Networks with real binary operations
